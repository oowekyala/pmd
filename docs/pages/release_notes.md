### 🚀 New and noteworthy

### 🌟 New and changed rules

#### New Rules
* The new Apex rule {% rule apex/bestpractices/QueueableWithoutFinalizer %} detects when the Queueable interface
  is used but a Finalizer is not attached. Without attaching a Finalizer, there is no way of designing error
  recovery actions should the Queueable action fail.
